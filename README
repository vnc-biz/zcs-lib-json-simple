Zimlet template
================

This package is a template for creating zimlets.

Getting started:

    * choose a name for the zimlets and correct the filenames:
	-> zimlets/biz_vnc_template directory
	-> zimlets/biz_vnc_template/src/biz_vnc_template.* files
	-> zimlets/biz_vnc_template/Makefile: variable ZIMLET_NAME

    * user-visible texts (eg. label and description) are stored in
      the translation property files

    * all files in zimlets/$(ZIMLET_NAME)/src will be packed into zipfile

    * in the xml file, the symbols @ZIMLET_NAME@, @ZIMLET_VERSION@ and
      will be replaced by the according Makefile variables

    * the version number comes from conf.mk

    * for development/testing builds, the environment variable $VERSION_SUFFIX
      should be set to produce special versions without changing the code
